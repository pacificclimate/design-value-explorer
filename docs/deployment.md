## Configuration

DVE is configured via two mechanisms:
- Environment variables for deployment parameters
- A configuration file (`config.yml`) for internal app configuration

### Environment variables

Environment variables configure major deployment parameters such as the
base path name and Gunicorn parameters.

`DASH_URL_BASE_PATHNAME`
- Base path for the app and all associated URLs including downloads

`LARGE_FILE_CACHE_SIZE`
- Number of large files (e.g., NetCDF data files) cached inside the app.

`SMALL_FILE_CACHE_SIZE`
- Number of small files (e.g., CSV files) cached inside the app.

`GUNICORN_<param>`
- GUNICORN configuration parameters. The Gunicorn configuration file
  (`docker/production/gunicorn.conf`) scrapes all environment variables
  of the form `GUNICORN_<param>` and sets value of configuration parameter
  `<param>` (converted to lowercase) to the value of the environment var.

### Configuration file

On startup, the app loads a configuration file (`config.yml`) containing
parameters used to direct the behaviour of the app. Configuration
parameters include:
- User interface defaults, settings, and labels (key `ui`)
- Filepaths to some data files (key `paths`)
- Filepaths and information about each design value (key `dvs`)
- Configuration of local preferences storage (key `local_config`)
- A miscellany of other values

Notes:

1. Filepaths are not absolute, and use `resource_pkgs.resource_filename`
set within `dve/` as a reference. This is not a desirable practice and
will 
[change](https://github.com/pacificclimate/dash-dv-explorer/issues/111) 
to absolute, direct filepaths at some point.

2. See the module docstring for module `dve/callbacks/local_preferences. py`
for details on how to configure local preferences. 

## Deploying locally for development

### Introduction

Using Docker for development is an expedient to avoid refactoring
the code to
[simplify its relationship to climpyrical](https://github.com/pacificclimate/dash-dv-explorer/issues/100) and
[improve the way data files are addressed](https://github.com/pacificclimate/dash-dv-explorer/issues/111). 
Avoiding the refactoring comes at some significant cost in Docker
complication, a cost which in the initial phases of this project was
worth the benefit, but which now outweighs it.

The `dve-dev-local` Docker image is the primary means for running the app while
developing and debugging. Using it has two advantages:
- It is very similar to the production environment.
- It reduces effort needed to install the supporting software.
- It maps a development configuration file onto `config.yml`.
  Typically, this configuration has a reduced dataset to speed startup, and
  uses local copies of large files ditto.

This image enables the developer to run the app in a Docker container, but
with "live" code updates visible inside the container. All infrastructure for
building and running this image is in `docker/dev-local`.

The image is normally built locally. (Because of this, there is no automated
build for the dev-local image as there is for the production image.) The image
installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, but does not install
`dash-dev-explorer`. The image need only be rebuilt when project dependencies
(`requirements.txt`) change.

After building, the image is run locally, and the
local codebase for `dash-dv-explorer` is mounted to it.
The container's first step (via the ENTRYPOINT) is to install that
local codebase.
With this arrangement, changes to the local codebase are available
directly inside the container. The container does not need to be restarted,
nor does the image need to be rebuilt in order to test code changes.

With the container running, the developer can run commands from inside it by
using `docker exec` commands. Most convenient is to use `docker exec` to run
an interactive `bash` shell in the container. From that bash shell all ordinary
commands can be run, including running tests and running the app.

### Instructions

1. **Advance prep**

   Do each of the following things *once per workstation*.

   1. Configure Docker user namespace mapping.

      1. Clone [`pdp-docker`](https://github.com/pacificclimate/pdp-docker).

      1. Follow the instructions in the `pdp-docker` documentation:
       [Setting up Docker namespace remapping (with recommended parameters)](https://github.com/pacificclimate/pdp-docker#setting-up-docker-namespace-remapping-with-recommended-parameters).

      1. Grant permissions on the downloads directory:

        ```
        setfacl -m "g:dockremap1000:rwx" docker/dev-local/downloads/ 
        ``` 

   1. Update the development config (`docker/dev-local/config.yml`) as 
      needed.

   1. Copy any large datasets (e.g., reconstructions) to your local 
      codebase
     (typically under `local-data/`). This cuts app startup time from minutes
     to seconds. App startup is incurred every time you make a change to the
     codebase and want to see the results.

1. **Build the image**

   The image need only be (re)built when the project is first cloned and when
   `requirements.txt` changes. To build the image:

    ```
    docker-compose -f docker/dev-local/docker-compose.yml build
    ```

   The image name is `pcic/dve-dev-local`.

1. **Start the container**

    ```
    docker-compose -f docker/dev-local/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

   The container name is `dve-dev-local`.

1. **Connect to a bash shell inside the container**

   When the container is running, you can connect to it and run a bash shell
   inside it with

    ```
    docker exec -it dve-dev-local bash
    ```

   You will see a prompt like

    ```
    dockremap@f4bcdc72b9f2:/codebase# 
    ```

   At this prompt you can enter bash commands, including the following:

1. **Start the app inside the container**

   From the container bash prompt:

    ```
    pipenv run python /codebase/dve_app.py --debug
    ```

   The `--debug` option does two things: Runs the server with `debug=True`, and
   defaults the logging level to `DEBUG`.

   Aside: Dash apps are based on Flask.
   Flask documentation
   [strongly recommends](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/server/#command-line)
   running apps for development using the Flask command line `flask run`.
   Unfortunately, that does not work for a Dash app, and we must run
   using a Python script as above.

   This enables the development environment, including the interactive debugger
   and reloader, and then starts the server on `http://localhost:5000/`.

   For more details, see the link above.

1. **Stop the container**

   When you have completed a cycle of development and testing, you may wish
   to stop the Docker container.

    ```
    docker-compose -f docker/dev-local/docker-compose.yml down
    ```

## Deploying a production instance

A production instance should be run in a production ready WSGI container
with proper process monitoring. We use [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) as
the WSGI container.

### Overview

1. A production Docker image, `pcic/dash-dv-explorer` is automatically built
   on Dockerhub.

1. All production-related Docker infrastructure is in the repo under
   `docker/production`.

1. Data files are mounted to the docker container.

1. A live-updatable configuration file can be mounted to the container.
   The `docker-compose.yml` contains a mount for this already, for a
   file at  `docker/production/config.yml`. You may wish to change this.

1. The usual `docker-compose` commands can be used to start, stop, and restart
   the container.

1. Proxying:
  - Dash applications apparently know the domain they are proxied from.
    (Guessing this is via an HTTP header.)
  - They do not know the base URL path used by the proxy, so this must be
    specified using the environment variable `DASH_URL_BASE_PATHNAME` as
    noted below.
  - The proxy *must not* strip the base path from the URLs forwarded to the
    Dash app.

Details follow.

### Prepare

1. Pull the desired version of `pcic/dash-dv-explorer` from Dockerhub.
1. Update (your copy of) `docker-compose.yml` to reflect the version
   of the image you want to run.
1. Update (your copy of) `.env`:
  1. IMPORTANT: Set `DASH_URL_BASE_PATHNAME` to the base path of the proxied
     URL. It must begin and end with `/`, e.g., `/design-value-explorer/`.
  1. Set the `GUNICORN_*` parameters as desired.
1. Update (your copy of) the configuration file if necessary.

### Start the container

```
docker-compose -f docker/production/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The container name is `dv-explorer-prod`. It immediately starts the application.

### Stop the container

```
docker-compose -f docker/production/docker-compose.yml down
```
