## For production

DVE is deployed in production using Docker. All installation related to
production deployments is encapsulated in the production Docker infrastructure.
For more details, see
[Deploying a production instance](deployment.md#deploying-a-production-instance).

## For development (using Docker)

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pacificclimate/dash-dv-explorer/
```

Because we primarily use a Docker image to run the code for testing and
development, there is (normally) no need to install and run the project
directly on a development machine. For details, see
[Deploying locally for development](deployment. md#deploying-locally-for-development).

## Installing and running directly (without Docker)

Installing and running directly in the local environment is not recommended,
mainly because it requires data files to be copied (or linked) into the project
directories. This is better accomplished by mounting them to a Docker image
that runs the app.

If for some reason, you do need to install and run the app directly, here's how.

### Install requirements
```
pipenv install
```

This installation may fail if Cython is not explicitly installed first.

### Install DVE
```
pipenv install -e dash-dv-explorer
```

### Run

If you have *all* datafiles copied into the local project
(i.e., the necessary datafiles in all `dve/data/` sudirectories), then you
can launch the app locally with

```
pipenv run python dve_app.py --debug
```
