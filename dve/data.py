"""
This module contains all the infrastructure for managing access to the data
(files) used by DVE.

The core of this module is the thread-safe caching of file objects. Because
Dash is multi-threaded, there can be concurrent requests for the same file,
and this can cause errors. The cache provides thread-safe mediation of file
access (and thread-safe access to itself, too, which is essential).

Two classes provide convenient thread-safe access to the two types
of file-data objects. They are structured very similarly and both use
(separate) thread safe caches to manage them. These classes also provide
thread-safe access to the data itself, which is probably unnecessary, since
all file access is conducted under the cache thread lock, forcing
serialization of access to *all* files. A more sophisticated approach to
cache invalidation (e.g., managing an "in-use" flag per cached item) would
provide for greater concurrency.

Finally, the perhaps too-generic `get_data` function uses the configuration
to turn convenient requests for data into actual file accesses, and  dispatches
these requests to the cached file objects.

TODO: Break this big file up into submodules: `Caching`, `DvXrDataset`,
  `PdCsvDataset`, and `get_data`.
TODO: Determine whether data access, which is read-only, needs thread locking.
TODO: `DvXrDataset`, `PdCsvDataset` have a very common structure. Factor this
  out into a base class factory.
